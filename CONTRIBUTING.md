# Contributing to Balluff LLM

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Balluff LLM as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the requirements.txt with any new dependencies
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/balluff-llm/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/balluff-llm/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting
* Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
* Use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
* Write tests for new features
* Update documentation for any changes

## Data Privacy and Security
