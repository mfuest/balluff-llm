        "response": "The functional principle of the BIS M-408-045-001-07-S4 is based on non-contact read/write technology. This system includes an evaluation electronic device and a permanently connected read/write head. It is used for programming and reading information on data carriers. Data and current status messages are transmitted from the identification system to the host system via a defined dialogue protocol. This dialogue protocol can also be used to transmit other commands to the read/write head, such as commands to switch off the read head antenna\nThe main components of the BIS M identification system are:\n\u2013 Read/write device: Manages data transmission between the read/write head and the data carrierss.\n\u2013 Data carrier:  Autonomous units that receive power from the read/write head and can perform static read operations once they receive the carrier wave signal"

        "response": "Data integrity with the BIS M-408-045-001-07-S4 is ensured through the use of a CRC_16 data check. This method involves writing a checksum to the data carrier, which allows the data to be checked for validity at any time. The CRC_16 data check provides very high data integrity, even during the non-active phase when the data carrier is outside the read/write head"

Connect the Sensor:\nConnect the sensor via IIoT or XF2/IIOT port with the network.\nConnect the power supply to the Power port with a 24 V power supply.\nThe sensor will start up and be operational after approximately 100 seconds 1 .\n\n2. Network Configuration:\nDepending on the network topology, different network settings must be made. In a company network or production facility, IP addresses are generally fixed.\nIf the sensor and PC are in the same subnet of a local network and no DHCP server is available for automatic IP assignment, the IP addresses of the PC and sensor must be matched and manually set.\nIf the sensor and PC are connected directly via a LAN cable, both devices will be assigned with LLA/Zeroconf IP addresses 169.254.x.x automatically. The PC needs to be set to \"Obtain IP addresses automatically\".\nIf the sensor and PC are in the same subnet of a local network and a DHCP server is available for automatic IP assignment, IP addresses are set automatically.\nIf the sensor and PC are in different subnets of a local network, communication with the sensor is still possible through switches 1 .\n\n3. Access the Sensor:\nOpen a web browser.\nEnter the following URL:\nhttp://192.168.10.2/\nConfirm the entry to access the sensor's configuration interface 1\n\nExecute Auto Setup (Optional):\nPress the Auto Setup button for at least 2 and up to 4 seconds.\nPosition the sensor using the red light beam to point to the target object.\nFix the sensor and press the Auto Setup button to confirm the positioning.\nThe sensor will automatically set the brightness and focus, which will take up to 20 seconds 1 .\n\nBy following these steps, you will establish a connection with the BVS camera BVS01ZE and be able to configure it for your application."
